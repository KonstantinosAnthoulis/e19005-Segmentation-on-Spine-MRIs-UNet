Πτυχιακή Εργασία Κωνσταντίνος Ανθούλης e19005 2023 2024 <br>
Undergrad Thesis Konstantinos Anthoulis e19005 2023 2024 <br> 
Datatset & Challenge: https://spider.grand-challenge.org/ <br>

## Dependencies
Before running the command below, after running terminal on your virtual environment of choice <br>
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
go in the file and remove the comment on the install you would like to perform depending on GPU/CPU setup <br>

## Additional Environment Setup
Due to the project structure 2 additional steps are needed <Br>
1) create a .env file in the project repo (gitignore passes through .env files that's why it's no there in the first place) and in it add
```
PYTHONPATH = ./
```
to ensure library imports will work due to file structure <br>

2) In VSCode go to Open User Settings (JSON) and paste the following:
```
{
  "python.analysis.extraPaths": ["./transforms", "./training", "./models", "./preprocessing"]
}

```
After executing those 2 steps all should be working: just change the paths in each script to point to your data directories as needed <Br>



## Script Order 
Execute the scripts in this order to recreate training environment on your machine

1) `dataset_split`: split dataset of 3D images 80/20 or ratio of choice <br>
splitting the 3D images and not the 2D images ensures series from the same patient are present in either train or test, not both at the same time<Br>
2) `extract_slices`: take 3D images apply resampling, then extract 2D images to train model on <br>
3) `crop_slices`: crop images to ROI as feature extraction/dimensionality reduction<br>
4) `tensor_dims`: comb through the dataset for tensor data (normalisation one-hot encoding etc) adn write data to .json file <br>
5) `train_init`: initialise training with untrained Unet <br>
6) `train_cont`: read model and optim states off path to continue training <Br>

## Run Monitoring
### Training Locally
Before running `train_init.py` or `train_cont.py`, run in python terminal:
```
tensorboard --logdir runs
```
This will run Tensorboard on localhost:6006 and you can view run progress in your browser

### Training on Microsoft Azure
work in progress
